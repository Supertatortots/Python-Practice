# 1. Donuts
# Given an int count of a number of donuts, return a string
# of the form 'Number of donuts: <count>', where <count> is the number
# passed in. However, if the count is 10 or more, then use the word 'many'
# instead of the actual count.
# So donuts(5) returns 'Number of donuts: 5'
# and donuts(23) returns 'Number of donuts: many'
def donuts(count):
  # Your code here
  return 'Number of donuts: ' + str(count if count < 10 else 'many')




# 2. both_ends
# Given a string s, return a string made of the first 2
# and the last 2 chars of the original string,
# so 'spring' yields 'spng'. However, if the string length
# is less than 2, return instead the empty string.
def both_ends(s):
  # Your code here
  if len(s) < 2:
    return ''
  return s[:2] + s[-2:]

  #   One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing between characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of n characters has index n, for example:

#  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
#  | P | y | t | h | o | n |
#  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
#  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
# -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1


# 3. fix_start
# Given a string s, return a string
# where all occurences of its first char have
# been changed to '*', except do not change
# the first char itself.
# e.g. 'babble' yields 'ba**le'
# Assume that the string is length 1 or more.
# Hint: s.replace(stra, strb) returns a version of string s
# where all instances of stra have been replaced by strb.
def fix_start(s):
  # Your code here
  first = s[0]
  rest_of_string = s[1:]
  updated_string = rest_of_string.replace(first, '*')
  return first + updated_string


# 4. mix_up
# Given strings a and b, return a single string with a and b separated
# by a space '<a> <b>', except swap the first 2 chars of each string.
# e.g.
#   'mix', pod' -> 'pox mid'
#   'dog', 'dinner' -> 'dig donner'
# Assume a and b are length 2 or more.
def mix_up(a, b):
  # Your code here
  a_swapped = b[:2] + a[2:]
  b_swapped = a[:2] + b[2:]
  return a_swapped + ' ' + b_swapped
